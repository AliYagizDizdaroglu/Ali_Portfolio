      <description>In this grand project I attempted to dive into Ivy&amp;rsquo;s world of AI! This was a joyful of journey that I met new peoples and systems. My responsibility was to implement and format data assets and functions. Though I had to confront various exciting technical situations which had been a great experience-dense boost to me!

      <description>This project consists of 2 different solutions to the expected results:
statistics.csv (cell characteristics and feature analysis) layered/masked images Solution 1, Manual Trained Model:
Chose a pretty common and robust DL algorithm/model named &amp;ldquo;U-net&amp;rdquo; which is a CNN type. Had to resize the images to 768x768 because of RAM issues. Then converted to original size forming pieces of small images. Size re-conversion is a bit scuffed. For details please see the code.</description>

      <description>The Ames Housing dataset was compiled by Dean De Cock for use in data science education. It&amp;rsquo;s an incredible alternative for data scientists looking for a modernized and expanded version of the often cited Boston Housing dataset. The data split in two-part train and test. The training dataset has target value (home price), the test set doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a target value and it needs to be predicted.

      <description>Steps conducted:
Text data acquisition using Twitter APIs for a week Preparation of training data Data preprocessing and cleaning Research to find the optimal algorithm in order to classify Eventually decided on Supervised Learning and Naive Bayes Multiclass Classification under 5 distinct categories Obtained 85% accuracy on classification for over 10,000 tweets Abstract:
Data science and particularly data itself have been a core part of living all along throughout human history.</description>

      <description>Objective: Days to death prediction After the &amp;ldquo;txt to csv&amp;rdquo; data wrangling process:
Common procedures throughout 2 models(XGBoost, RandomForest):
dropping demographic_id as it is unique to person and no use for us
dropping age_at_diagnosis, we have the same as days_to_birth
changing paper_clinical_stage to number respectively (1,2,3,4)
changing vital_status to number respectively (0,1)
finding current age = days_to_birth / -365.24
had to convert to int indirectly (&amp;ldquo;vital_status&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;paper_clinical_stage&amp;rdquo;)
dropping dead with unknown year_of_death as it makes no sense</description>

      <description>Hey there,
I am a software developer, explicitly talking, Data Science &amp;amp; ML. Henceforth, conducted an ML/DS project as a graduation project. In this project, I classified the Tweets received from Twitter APIs, under 5 categories. The used programming language was Python. I also presented this project at an international conference, namely ICEECE 2021.
Externally, took the TOEFL test last year and got a 92. Also finished the ML course of Stanford University which was lectured by Andrew NG.</description>
